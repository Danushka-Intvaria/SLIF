Government initiatives aim to leverage this advantage to boost exports and strengthen the sector’s contribution to GDP, supported by preferential trade access to the EU, UK, and South Asia. The Board of Investment (BOI) facilitates manufacturing growth through tax incentives, duty exemptions, and streamlined approvals, alongside sector-focused industrial zones for apparel, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. With resilient export performance, expanding subsectors, and strong policy support, Sri Lanka offers a diversified and investor-friendly manufacturing ecosystem, laying the foundation for sustainable growth and profitable market access."

    "overview": [
      "Sri Lanka’s Renewable Energy & Sustainable Utilities sector offers robust long-term investment potential, driven by ambitious energy transition goals, rising electricity demand, and a focus on climate resilience. The government has committed to achieving 70% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030, supported by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and the Ministry of Power and Energy. To meet this target, the country plans to add approximately 4,705 MW of solar and 1,825 MW of wind capacity, alongside hydro and biomass projects, reflecting a clear pipeline for investment. Renewable energy already accounts for a significant share of electricity generation, contributing around 60% in 2023, demonstrating tangible progress toward the 2030 goal. Abundant solar, wind, hydro, and biomass resources provide a solid foundation for further expansion, while government-facilitated frameworks, including BOI incentives for private sector participation, ensure a conducive environment for investment in clean energy generation and sustainable utility infrastructure.",
      "The sector’s growth is further supported by a pipeline of 2,700+ MW of grid-scale renewable projects, many of which are at the provisional or PPA stage, highlighting strong near-term investment opportunities. Expansion is expected to create over 100,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing to local economic development, while initiatives in the sector target a reduction of more than 20 million tons of CO₂ emissions annually by 2030, aligning with global climate commitments. Policy frameworks, long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), and BOI facilitation provide investor confidence, while rising fossil fuel costs strengthen the financial viability of renewable projects. Emerging areas such as energy storage, electric mobility infrastructure, and biomass-to-energy solutions are opening new avenues for technology-driven investments. With strategic location, growing industrial demand, and an ambitious sustainability agenda, Sri Lanka presents a highly attractive destination for long-term investments in renewable energy and sustainable utilities."
